## Project Overview
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. I gathered data on WeRateDogs twitter archive from different sources; their Twitter archive that was downloaded manually, and extra tweet information using Twitter API. I also had access to an image prediction data. Using Python libraries, I assessed the different data for quality and tidiness issues and cleaned all the issues I identified, so as to obtain data that can easily be used for analysis and visualizations. 

## Questions for Analysis
1. Which dog stage received the highest average rating?
2. Is there a difference between the average retweet and favorite counts for different dog stages?
3. What is the level of correlation between rating and reactions(favorite and retweet counts)?
4. What breed of dog was predicted the most with the greatest confidence?
5. What source was used the most for posting ratings?
6. What is the distribution of WeRateDogs tweets over time?
7. What is the distribution of tweets by day of week?
